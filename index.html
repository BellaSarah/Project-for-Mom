    <h1>I Love You Mom!!</h1>

    <p>
        Hey, I thought I might tell you a few things that I adore about you!
        A few reasons we click, and a few things that I am grateful for with you!
        I could use this as a birthday, or a mother's day present if I want...
        But I might just give it as a gift just to say I love you!
    </p>

    <div>
        <ol>
            <li id="one">You are a shining light!
                <ul>
                    <li>You show up for everyone, anytime we need!</li>
                    <li>You hardly ever get in a bad mood, and you spread positivity, joy, and love wherever you go</li>
                    <li>You are always there to listen. You'll listen to someone for hours at a time, and not care how long it goes!
                        You give so much and it's why you're my person. You know more about me than myself!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You will be stupid with me!
            </li>
            <p id="two">On car rides, and our shopping trips you'll go crazy with me! You'll let me be me.
                I know how much you want to have deep conversations, and yet you'll let me have my crazy music time!
                You'll let me be me, never judging, and always letting me feel safe, and loved!
            </p>
            <li>
                You are always cleaning up after me.
            </li>
            <p>
                I know this is on me, I know that I need to be better at cleaing up, and I know that I'm definently could be better.
                But you not only clean up after me even though you don't have to. But you don't make me feel horrible about it.
                You give me grace, and you'll tease me, but you never use it against me.
            </p>
            <li>You dress impeccably.</li>

            <li id="three">You are a wonderful mother!</li>
        </ol>
         <p>
            The way you light up when you see water. Our trips to half moon bay, and Carmel By The Sea, <strong>you become another person!</strong>

    <p>You're a caregiver! You do whatever you can to help others. You go out of your way to do something for someone else.
        Even when you're down yourself. You are such an amazing person and I'm so happy to call you my Mom! Thank you for everything!
    </p>
        <img src="img/goldendoodle.jpg" alt="Adorable dog, almost as cute as your own.">
    <p id="george">
        You're also a proud pet mom of a very adorable dog
        
        <ul>
            <li>You do so many amazing things for others, and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.</li>
            <li>You don't take crap from anyone, and you know your own worth.</li>
            <li>Even through <strong>a very <i>"fun" </i>divorce </strong> you still stand your ground, and taught both your daughters it's ok to get 
            out of a bad relationship, no matter what ties you have to them.</li>
        </ul>

        You are such a strong woman, and such a wonderful role model for your daughters. You've helped me through so much
        and because of that you are one of the people in my life that I trust the most.
    </p>

    <p id="five">You've taught me so much, and you continue to teach, and help me day by day. You don't give up on me 
        even when I get testy. You are one of the most amazing people in my life. And for that I'll never be able to thank you enough!
    </p>

    <h2>To the best Mom I could ever have. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!</h2>
