    <h1>I Love You Mom!!</h1>

    <p>
        Hey, I thought I might tell you a few things that I adore about you!
        A few reasons we click, and a few things that I am grateful for with you!
        I could use this as a birthday, or a mother's day present if I want...
        But I might just give it as a gift just to say I love you!
    </p>

    <div>
        <ol>
            <li id="one">You are a shining light!
                <ul>
                    <li>You show up for everyone, anytime we need!</li>
                    <li>You hardly ever get in a bad mood, and you spread positivity, joy, and love wherever you go</li>
                    <li>You are always there to listen. You'll listen to someone for hours at a time, and not care how long it goes!
                        You give so much and it's why you're my person. You know more about me than myself!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You will be stupid with me!
            </li>
            <p id="two">On car rides, and our shopping trips you'll go crazy with me! You'll let me be me.
                I know how much you want to have deep conversations, and yet you'll let me have my crazy music time!
                You'll let me be me, never judging, and always letting me feel safe, and loved!
            </p>
            <li>
                You are always cleaning up after me.
            </li>
            <p>
                I know this is on me, I know that I need to be better at cleaing up, and I know that I'm definently could be better.
                But you not only clean up after me even though you don't have to. But you don't make me feel horrible about it.
                You give me grace, and you'll tease me, but you never use it against me.
            </p>
            <li>You dress impeccably.</li>
